https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand


Bike sharing program is a transporation system that provides affordable access to bikes in urban areas. The data generated by bike sharing program can help researchers understand behaviors of bike share users and mobility patterns. The goal of this kaggle project is to combine historic bike share usage and weather data to predict bikeshare demand in Washington DC. 

## The data
### Data source
- The data was downloaded from '''Bike Sharing Demand''' competition on kaggle.com 
- There are total of 10886 rows of data, collected from 24 months period in Washington DC
